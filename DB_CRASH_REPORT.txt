Error: Hasura Connection Error
Detail: Hasura cannot connect to Postgres Database.
Internal Error: `FATAL: could not open file "global/pg_filenode.map": Input/output error`

This indicates a CORRUPTED Database File System on the Server (Ghaymah Cloud).
This is NOT a code issue in your Next.js project.
The Postgres instance on the server has a corrupted disk or file permission issue.

Action Required:
You MUST contact the server provider (Ghaymah) or if you have access, Restart/Recreate the Postgres Service.
Simply restarting the Next.js app will NOT fix this.
The database itself is broken.
